[vidz.fun](https://vidz.fun) plays videos directly from YouTube, grouping them together for easier and more concise viewing.<br />
No official features are removed or ignored, including ads, alerts, and so.

Since it runs directly from the browser, the account playing the videos will always be the same one already logged into YouTube. This means that all videos watched on the page will be displayed normally in the platform's history. Accounts with YouTube Premium will also not display ads when playing videos on [vidz.fun](https://vidz.fun).
